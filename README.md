# ToDoApplication
This project is a web application built using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, JSP for the view layer, and Spring Data JPA for data access. It allows users to manage ToDo items by performing CRUD operations through a web interface. The front-end is styled using Bootstrap and includes Toastr.js for displaying notifications.

Spring Framework: It's a comprehensive framework for building Java enterprise applications. It provides various modules for different functionalities such as dependency injection, MVC framework, transaction management, etc.

Spring Boot: It's an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying Spring-based applications. It provides defaults for code and annotation configuration to quick start new Spring projects easily.

JSP (JavaServer Pages): JSP is a technology used to create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. In this project, JSP files are used to create the user interface for adding, editing, and viewing ToDo items.

JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library): JSTL is a collection of useful JSP tags which encapsulates core functionality common to many JSP applications. It's used here for iteration (<c:forEach>) and conditional logic (<c:if>).

Bootstrap: It's a popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files are included to style and add interactivity to the UI components.

Toastr.js: It's a JavaScript library for non-blocking notifications. It's used to display success or error messages to the user after actions like adding, editing, or deleting ToDo items.

HTML and CSS: These are used for structuring the web pages and styling them, respectively.

jQuery: It's a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Here, it's used for DOM manipulation and making AJAX calls for handling form submissions without refreshing the page.

Controller classes: These are Java classes annotated with @Controller or @RestController annotations. They handle incoming HTTP requests, execute business logic, and return appropriate responses. In this project, they likely handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for ToDo items.

Model classes: These are Java classes representing the data of the application. They are typically annotated with @Entity or used as DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API): It's a part of the Spring Data project and provides an abstraction layer on top of JPA. It simplifies database access by abstracting most of the boilerplate code and providing convenient methods for CRUD operations.
